2. Every applicant should solve **all** the general questions.
3. An applicant must solve frontend questions if applying for a frontend position.
4. An applicant must solve backend questions if applying for a backend position.
5. Solving both, is a bonus :)
6. When you finish this test, send an e-mail containing the repository link and the salary expectations to <hungryforthisjob@oplab.com.br>

5. Using the twitter API, create a script that given a word as an input, outputs the last 10 tweets containing that word.

### Frontend

_We will be evaluating everything, from reproduction accuracy, to process. If you use ( with mastery ) tools/frameworks such as `gulp`, `react`, `angular`, `webpack`, etc..; we will take that in consideration. Also: we care about beautiful code (~~var~~) üëæ_

Reproduce, faithfully, this [page]( http://ydirection.com/Aria/index-3.html ).

### Backend

_I know, I know... It looks easy compared to the frontend challenge; but don't be fooled! We expect **more** from your answers in here! We will evaluate **how** you answer, and your answer's organization and structure!_

Answer the following questions:
- Suppose you're working with 3 people on a project. What would be **the** ideal software development process?
- How do you think an entity relationship diagram for _Instagram_ would be like?
- Now that you have imagined the ER diagram, **how** would you build _Instagram_ from scratch?


That's it! Thanks for doing this test!
